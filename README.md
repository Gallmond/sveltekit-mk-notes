# Notes

## BACKLOG

- Handle firebase errors (registry and sign-in etc. Currently there's no handling)

## TODO

### Functionality

- Pinned notes should stay at the top of the list always
- If a current note is pinned, the pin button on the top bar should be active
- Should be able to press enter to create a new tag instead of clicking add
- Settings page
  - Delete account button
  - Delete all notes button
- Add CTRL + N for new note shortcut

### Visuals

- The tags overflow in the side bar. Make it truncate with an ... or some other indicator that there's more?
- The new tags input isn't spaced right
- empty space next to create note, maybe move it side by side with search bar?
