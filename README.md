# Notes

## BACKLOG

- Handle firebase errors (registry and sign-in etc. Currently there's no handling)

## TODO

### Functionality

- Should be able to press enter to create a new tag instead of clicking add
- Settings page
  - Delete account button
  - Delete all notes button
- Add CTRL + N for new note shortcut
- On first load, if not logged in the account page should be displayed
- remove all debug console logs and refactor

### Visuals

- The tags overflow in the side bar. Make it truncate with an ... or some other indicator that there's more?
- The new tags input isn't spaced right
- empty space next to create note, maybe move it side by side with search bar?
